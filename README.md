- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Using API for the loading state. 
2. Discuss further about usig the view controller to retrieve data from APIs.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had difficulty using a 3rd party progress HUD and if I had more time I would have it implemented. As for changing the color of a cell that proved harder than expected. I assumed it would be an option on the right panel when on the storyboard However that wasn't the case. I tried hard coding the color change of the background and that method did not work either.
